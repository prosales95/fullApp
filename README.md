# Full-App
=======

I'm still working on this project. My objective is to have a manual to cook different latin american recipes by country and geographic zone. I have some other partners working on this project.

### Getting the base project set up
First clone the project in your desired location.
Run the command `npm install` to install dependencies. After having Ionic all set up run `ionic serve` to launch the local server.
