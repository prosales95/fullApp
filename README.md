# Full-App
=======

I'm still working on this project. My objective is to have a manual to cook different latin american recipes by country and geographic zone. 

### Getting the base project set up

 
*) First clone the project in your desired location.

*)Run the command `npm install` to install dependencies. 

!! Set up a lightserver using my json-server folder:
*) By using `npm install json-server -g` and finally `json-server --watch db.json -d 2000` this sets a delay of 2 seconds. 
 
 *)After having Ionic all set up run `ionic serve` to launch the local server.
